# NEPAL-EARTHQUAKE-DATA-ARCHIVE-FEM-vs-AEM-Model-Comparison
This repository contains a PDF report (https://github.com/arbarbosa/NEPAL-EARTHQUAKE-DATA-ARCHIVE-FEM-vs-AEM-Model-Comparison/blob/master/Soti_et_al_2019_ValidationReport.pdf), which provides two basic examples comparing Applied Element Method model results with Finite Element Method model results, for models dominated by flexural deformations with the intent of modeling pagoda temples. 

This repository will be transformed into a DOI, in case the corresponding submitted manuscript is accepted for publication. 

Other information, including the FEM and AEM models described in the PDF report can be found in the following data archive:
